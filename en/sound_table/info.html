				<p class="ns mb">We live immersed in endless visual stimuli and information through social media, Reels, TikTok, OTT platforms, and YouTube. This environment continuously supplies dopamine, enabling us to spend time alone without boredom. As technology advances, we're shifting towards an era where most tasks can be accomplished online without facing uncomfortable situations directly. The COVID-19 pandemic has further normalized spending time physically alone, seemingly diminishing our ability to be fully present with others.</p>
				<p class="ns mb">We live immersed in endless visual stimuli and information through social media, Reels, TikTok, OTT platforms, and YouTube. This environment continuously supplies dopamine, enabling us to spend time alone without boredom. As technology advances, we're shifting towards an era where most tasks can be accomplished online without facing uncomfortable situations directly. The COVID-19 pandemic has further normalized spending time physically alone, seemingly diminishing our ability to be fully present with others.
				</p>
				<p class="ns mb">Nevertheless, we maintain a paradoxical desire to resonate with others without words. Phrases like "enjoying someone's mere presence" or "understanding without speaking" might emerge from situations where verbal communication sometimes unnecessarily complicates interactions.	</p>
				</p>
				<p class="ns mb">This irony - feeling disconnected in an era of constant connectivity - inspired the creation of "Sound Table - Floating Body," a neo-product. This work is a sound table designed for resonating with others through abstract, sensory means rather than explicit verbal communication.</p>
				</p>
				<p class="ns mb">"Sound Table - Floating Body" transmits users' actions through subtle synesthesia via the medium of a table. The installation consists of a pair of tables, each containing soundscapes based on field recordings of their surrounding environmental noise. When a user rests their head or performs specific actions on one table, the counterpart table emanates sounds from the other space. This allows users to sense their counterpart's presence on a similar table in real-time, albeit in a different location. The installation connects tactile actions with auditory experiences, enabling sensory sharing across physical distances. Through the simple act of resting their head on the table, users can aurally share their counterpart's environment and experience the sensation of lying in the same position.
				</p>
				<p class="ns mb">"Sound Table - Floating Body" prompts reconsideration of current communication methods and explores possibilities for sensory connection beyond language. It functions as a contemplative object in everyday life, encouraging reflection on human connection in the technological age.
