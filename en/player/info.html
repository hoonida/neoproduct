			<section>
				<p class="ns mb">The act of tuning into frequencies within noise and observing what emerges. The yearning to grasp the intangible.</p>
				<p class="ns mb">I make field recordings of places that seem to be on the verge of disappearing. With these sounds, I create a unique 'player 2024' - not a conventional player, but one that invites deep reflection.
				</p>
				<p class="ns mb">Like tuning an old radio, I search for sounds that emerge faintly from white noise as I turn the dial. These sounds manifest as dreamlike melodies while simultaneously pointing to specific locations. As one approaches and contemplates these locations, the sounds gradually become more distinct.	</p>
				</p>
				<p class="ns mb">This ethereal melody is created by stretching the temporality of environmental sounds - recorded as a testament to places rapidly vanishing due to development - like pulling taffy. To a casual listener, it may simply be a player producing dreamlike music. However, with more conscious and active engagement, one might discover the fundamental sounds that exist within a single layer.</p>
				</p>
				<p class="ns mb">The process of finding frequencies in noise, discovering sounds, and uncovering their essence mirrors how we contemplate what we gain and lose as we continuously adjust and adapt to various changes in life.
