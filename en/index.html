		<h1>NEO product</h1>
		<p>The accelerating technology development not only makes life more convenient but is now becoming the most significant factor that affects culture, the way of thinking, and the social system. The way of consuming art as well as perceiving and embodying everything in life is also changing. Now, we will have to doubt and reread ‘the reality’ that we have previously believed. This project started with those ideas. </p>
		<p class="in">The artist has been carefully looking at the form of ‘triggers’ that usually cause a change of thought with a device for performing and conveying something. This kind of interest changed into the idea that it would be nice if an object could play such a role in the artist’s everyday life. In the meantime, the artist came up with the idea of an object that could be installed not in museums but indoor spaces available for more ‘private immersion’; he focused on the form of ‘product’ in having an interest in objects that play various roles indoors, such as furniture and lightings. </p>
		<p class="in">Until now, the purpose of products has been to increase actual efficiency and make things convenient in our daily lives. As having kept products indoors for a long time, people valued the aesthetic aspects as important as the functional aspects. Products have been required to be appropriately suited to spaces where they are placed, sometimes to have a strong presence, and asked to be made of forms that people would not get tired of even if they keep using them. Sometimes products that focused on aesthetic forms rather than their original functions are produced as well. </p>
		<p class="in">In this exhibition, the artist would propose a new product format called ‘NEO product.’ As a long-term project, NEO product, which reorganizes the form of products anew and shows a new way of consuming and appreciating vision with hearing and art with sound, is introduced in several series. Above all, the NEO product aims to ‘make itself useful to the user’s mind (a switch of perspective changes)’ and to make me reflect on seeing the object.</p>
		<p class="in">‘NEO product’ is not fixed to the product’s efficient and mechanical functioning, but newly declares and defines a product as having the function of a thinking object. At the starting point for presenting novel values and moments to re-recognize the concept of a product. The artist does issue the manifesto composed of seven sentences with the NEO product prototype.</p>
